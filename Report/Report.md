#### Key Trends  

One of the key trends observed was that for nearly all metrics in the  
dataset, the mean value for energy use or greenhouse gas emissions was  
always much larger than the median value. This trend in the data  
suggests that there are certain buildings that are the main cause  
for a large portion of overall energy consumption and emissions.  
This was shown by the large number of outliers that were detected  
when analyzing total greenhouse gas emissions. If the buildings  
in the dataset all had similar emissions, then there would be few  
outliers, but in this dataset nearly 10% of all buildings were  
considered outliers in total greenhouse gas emissions, which is  
a large percentage considering outliers are often discarded.  


#### Seasonal and Property Type Variations  

Overall energy use intensity varied from year to year, with the most  
noticeable change coming from a drop in energy use intensity between  
2019 and 2020. This initial drop was able to be sustained the following  
year of 2021. It was also seen that there was a large difference in  
energy use intensity between different property types. This shows that  
certain facilities by their nature are more energy intensive than others  
and might require more focus or attention when considering which  
types of locations have the greatest energy impact.  


#### Recommendations for Improving Energy Efficiency and Reducing Emissions  

Given the observation that the Stoney Transit Facility emits the  
most greenhouse gases of any building by a large margin, reducing  
total emissions should start with a deeper investigation as to why  
that specific facility emits so much more greenhouse gases than  
other facilities. If emissions from the top emitters can be reduced,  
the overall impact can be greater. For energy efficiency, it was  
observed that specific facility types such as heated swimming pools,  
fitness centers, and distribution centers had the highest energy  
usage intensity. Similar to the first point, if those types of  
facilities are able to reduce their energy use intensity then the  
overall impact of energy use can be reduced.
